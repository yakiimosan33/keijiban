- **Character counter** with visual feedback
- **Input sanitization** and XSS prevention
- **Rate limiting** (10 comments per minute)
- **Accessibility features** and proper ARIA attributes
- **Form state management** with pristine/touched states

### 6. Updated Rate Limiting API (`lib/api.ts`)
- **Detailed rate limit information** with countdown timers
- **Separate methods** for checking vs. consuming attempts
- **Time until reset** calculations
- **User-friendly error messages** in Japanese
- **Client-side rate limiting** with localStorage persistence

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Validation Rules
- **Title**: 1-120 characters, required, HTML sanitized
- **Body/Comment**: 1-4000 characters, required, HTML sanitized
- **Real-time validation** on input with debounced feedback
- **Touch-based validation** (only show errors after user interaction)

### Character Count Color Coding
- **Green (0-70%)**: Safe usage, normal text color
- **Yellow (70-90%)**: Approaching limit, warning color
- **Red (90-100%)**: At or near limit, danger color

### Rate Limiting
- **Posts**: 3 per minute per IP (client-side tracking)
- **Comments**: 10 per minute per IP (client-side tracking)
- **Countdown timers** with real-time updates
- **Visual indicators** for remaining attempts

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA labels** and descriptions for form fields
- **Screen reader support** with live regions for updates
- **Keyboard navigation** with proper focus management
- **Color contrast** compliance for all visual indicators
- **Error announcements** via aria-live regions

### Input Sanitization
- **HTML entity encoding** for <, >, ", ', / characters
- **XSS prevention** through proper escaping
- **Whitespace trimming** for validation
- **Preserved original formatting** where appropriate

## 🧪 Testing Implementation

### Manual Testing
- Created comprehensive test page (`public/test-validation.html`)
- Real browser testing with interactive form
- Character counter visual verification
- Rate limiting timer functionality
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

### Test Coverage
- **Field validation** edge cases (empty, too long, special chars)
- **Input sanitization** with XSS attempts
- **Character counting** accuracy and color changes
- **Rate limiting** enforcement and countdown
- **Form state management** (pristine, touched, focused)
- **Accessibility** with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## 🎨 UX/UI Enhancements

### Visual Feedback
- **Progress bars** for character usage
- **Color-coded counters** based on usage ratio
- **Real-time error/warning messages**
- **Loading spinners** during form submission
- **Success/error toast notifications**

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Touch-friendly** input fields (min 44px height)
- **Responsive layout** for all screen sizes
- **Proper viewport handling**
- **Optimized for mobile keyboards**

### User Experience
- **Real-time feedback** without page reloads
- **Graceful error handling** with recovery guidance
- **Form persistence** during validation
- **Auto-focus** on error fields
- **Intuitive visual cues** for all states

## 📱 Browser Compatibility
- **Modern browsers** with ES6+ support
- **Mobile Safari** and Chrome optimized
- **Accessibility APIs** properly implemented
- **Progressive enhancement** approach

## 🔒 Security Features
- **Input sanitization** prevents XSS attacks
- **Client-side validation** (server-side validation recommended)
- **Rate limiting** prevents spam/abuse
- **No sensitive data** in localStorage
- **Proper error handling** without information leakage

## 📊 Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced validation** to reduce processing
- **Efficient re-renders** with React optimization
- **Minimal DOM updates** for character counters
- **Lazy validation** (only after user interaction)
- **Optimized component updates** with useCallback

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Import validation utilities from `lib/validation`
2. Use `CharacterCounter` component for any input field
3. Add `RateLimitIndicator` for forms with rate limiting
4. Follow the FormValidator class pattern for complex forms

### For Users
1. Form shows real-time feedback as you type
2. Character counters change color as limits approach
3. Error messages appear below fields after interaction
4. Rate limiting shows countdown when limits reached
5. Accessible via keyboard and screen readers
